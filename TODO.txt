# TODO List for GemMind: AI-Powered Gemstone Classification

## Data Preparation
- [ ] Clean and preprocess `master.csv` (handle missing values, normalize attributes)
- [ ] Implement image augmentation for better model generalization
- [ ] Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets

## Model Development
- [ ] Build initial CNN model for gemstone classification
- [ ] Experiment with different architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet, etc.)
- [ ] Fine-tune model hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs)
- [ ] Implement early stopping and learning rate scheduling

## Training & Evaluation
- [ ] Train model on full dataset
- [ ] Evaluate model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- [ ] Implement confusion matrix visualization for misclassified images
- [ ] Test model on unseen gemstone images

## Inference & Deployment
- [ ] Create a script to classify new gemstone images
- [ ] Optimize model for faster inference (quantization, ONNX conversion)
- [ ] Package model into a Docker container for easy deployment

## Documentation & Maintenance
- [ ] Write detailed README with setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Add docstrings and comments to all scripts
- [ ] Create sample Jupyter Notebook for quick testing
- [ ] Set up automated testing for model performance
- [ ] Implement logging and error handling

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement gemstone price prediction based on image and metadata
- [ ] Add support for real-time gemstone classification via webcam
